      <b>
        <p> I am a didicated person with an urge to learn adn grow.My name is Ashraful Alam,and i feel life is a journey
        that leads to self-discover. I belong to a middle-class family, my father is businessman, and my mother is a
        house wife<br><br>
        I have learned punctuality and discipline are the two wheels that drive or life on a positive path. my mother is
        m role model. I am passionate about reading novels. When I wa younger, my grandmother used to marrate stories
        about her life in the past and that has built m interest towards reading stories and novels related to
        history.<br><br>
        Overall I am an optimistiv person who looks forward to life as a subject that teaches us values and ways to live
        for the upliftment of society.
